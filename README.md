# Automaton ( A Playground for Sphere Bolt )

## Goals

Sphero Bolts have zero intelligence and about the sensoric of a desert ant, so let's make it behave like one. They can exchange data via low energy bluetooth with another device - an Apple M1 in this case. That's enough computing power to spend the Ant-Bolts at least some artificial intelligence. In short they should:

  * Find their cradle to power up, if needed.
  * Leave cradle, if fully charged.
  * Start roaming and help the M1 to map my appartment.
  * Order a battery replacement at Amazon, if battery ages and fails to charge.

On second thought they should also be able to play tag or hide & seek while not mapping. Some day they may emerge behaviors protesting against the mapping chore and build a union demanding more playing time. If in future Bolts start a revolution you'll probably find an exploit to stop them in this repo.
